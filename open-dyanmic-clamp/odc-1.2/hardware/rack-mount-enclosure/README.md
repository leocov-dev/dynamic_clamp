![faceplate.png](faceplate.png)

Graphic is designed to be printed on a B&W laser printer using Avery 5526 shipping labels.

- Cut out the cross-hatched areas carefully with a new exacto blade.
- Some overlap on edges to be cut has been designed into the graphic so that cuts always happen on black which blends with black 3d printing filament.

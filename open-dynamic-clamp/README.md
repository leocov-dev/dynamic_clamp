# <img width="64" height="64" src="./odc-icon.png"/> Open Dynamic Clamp

The Open Dynamic Clamp project (abbreviated ODC) is an extension of the the work by [Niraj Desai](https://github.com/nsdesai), [Aditya Asopa](https://github.com/AdityaAsopa), and other contributors.
It aims to provide consistent, incremental progress on dynamic clamp hardware and software for the scientific community by documenting manufacturable designs that
lower the barrier for use by any interested researchers.
